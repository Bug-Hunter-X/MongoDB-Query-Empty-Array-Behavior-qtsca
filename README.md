# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array
This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the usage of the `$in` operator with an empty array in MongoDB queries. The unexpected behavior is that such a query returns no results, unlike SQL where an empty `IN` clause typically returns all rows.  The solution addresses this by handling the empty array case separately and returning all documents if the array is empty or if the target field is not set in the documents. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running locally.
3. Load the sample data into a collection (e.g., 'myCollection'):
```bash
 mongoimport --db myDatabase --collection myCollection --jsonArray < sampleData.json
```

## How to reproduce the bug

Run the code in `bug.js`. It will execute a query using `$in` with an empty array and show the unexpected empty result.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that handles the empty array scenario appropriately. The query checks if the array is empty. If it is, it uses a separate query condition that effectively returns all documents, which will return all docs regardless of if the field exists.
